Challenge:
***********

Let's help the Dinosaur Data Management System answer the question: what is the age range of a population of dinosaurs in an area? So given an array of dinosaur ages, write an algorithm that calculates and returns the age range. 

ageRange = maximumAge - minimumAge

For example if you have the ages: 8, 51, 3, 64, 1, 75, 9, 100, then the age range, which is the difference between the maximum age in the array, 100, and the minimum age, 1, is 99.


Examples:
**********

Example 1:
ages = [8, 51, 3, 64, 1, 75, 9, 100]
result = 99

Example 2:
ages = [8, 2, 5, 12, 3]
const result = 10


Constraints:
***********

ages.length >= 1


Tasks:
******

1. Write the algorithm as steps in plain English.
2. Implement the steps in JavaScript. Name the function getAgeRange. 
3. When you’re done, run the test cases in the terminal using the command `npm test` and they should all pass. If a test doesn't pass, debug your code and fix what's wrong.
4. When you’re done, analyze the time and space complexity of your algorithm and write it down in Big O notation.
