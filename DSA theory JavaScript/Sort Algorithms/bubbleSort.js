/*
Algorithm: Bubble Sort
Input: array of numbers
Output: the array with the numbers sorted in place and in ascending order

Steps:
1. Iterate n - 1 times:
2.   Iterate from the start of the array to the end of the unsorted numbers:
3.     If the current number is greater than the one after it:
4.       Swap the numbers. Bubble the greater number up.
