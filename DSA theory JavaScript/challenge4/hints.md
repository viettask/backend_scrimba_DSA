Hints:

1. How could you use a stack to see if there was a matching opening bracket for the closing bracket you are currently looking at?
2. You only care about the brackets in this question. Ignore everything else: the numbers and the operators.
3. If there are still opening brackets in the stack after you go over the entire expression, what does that mean?
4. Start by initializing an empty stack.
5. Go over each character in the expression.
6. If it's an opening bracket, put it in the stack.
7. Else if it's a closing bracket, ensure the stack is not empty and peek at the top of the stack to see if there is a matching opening bracket previously seen. If there is one, pop it. If there is not or the stack was empty, return `false`.
8. Ignore any character that is neither an opening nor a closing bracket.
9. After going over the entire expression, check if the stack is empty.
10. If it is empty, then all opening brackets had matching closing brackets. Return `true`.
11. If the stack was not empty, that means there were opening brackets left unmatched. Return `false`.
