1. O(n) 
n is the input to the algorithm

2. Big O Notation
A way to describe how fast an algorithm runs in relation to the input

3.  time complexity

4. Space complexity 
The amount of memory space an algorithm uses during execution in relation to the input.

5. Big O simplification rules
2 rules:
    1. Drop the constant multipliers
    2. Drop the non-dominant terms.
    
6. Array can be 
    Static : fixed length. can not change afterwards
    danamic : flexible. javascript always dynamic

7. String = text
    A sequence of characters

8. Sorting Algorithms
    Bubble Sort: swap 2 number at start
        Time complexity: O(n^2)
        Space complexity: O(1)
    Merge Sort: A fast sorting algorithms with a time complexity of O(n logn)
        divide half and merge sort
        Divide and Conquer



9.  Search Algorithm
    Linear Search
        Time complexity: O(n)
        Space complexity: O(1)
    Binary Search
        An efficient searching algorithm with a time complexity of O(log n)
    
10. Other algorithms
    Map :   A collection of unique key-value pairs with O(1) lookup time complexity
            When to use a map: if have unique keys of data + fast lookup 
    Stacks
    Queues
    Linked list
    Trees
    Binary Search Trees (BST)
    Graph

11. Recursion
    Ex: Factorial
        0! = 1
        n! = n * (n-1)!
