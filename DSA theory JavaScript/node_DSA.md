1. O(n) 
n is the input to the algorithm

2. Big O Notation
A way to describe how fast an algorithm runs in relation to the input

3.  time complexity

4. Space complexity 
The amount of memory space an algorithm uses during execution in relation to the input.

5. Big O simplification rules
2 rules:
    1. Drop the constant multipliers
    2. Drop the non-dominant terms.
    
6. Array can be 
    Static : fixed length. can not change afterwards
    danamic : flexible. javascript always dynamic

7. String = text
    A sequence of characters

8. Sorting Algorithms
    Bubble Sort
    Merge Sort

9.  Search Algorithm
    Binary Search
    Map 
    Stacks
    Queues
    Linked list
    Trees
