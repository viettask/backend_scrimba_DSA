Challenge:
**********

In a graph representing a portion of the Dinosaur social network, find out if two given dinosaurs are "connected". To be "connected", there needs to be a path from one dinosaur to the other. The path could be longer than 1, i.e. the connection does not need to be direct.


Examples:
**********

Example 1:
```
dinosaurs = [0, 4]

adjacency list = [
    [1, 2],
    [0, 3],
    [0, 3, 4],
    [1, 2],
    [2],
    [6],
    [5, 7],
    [6, 8],
    [7]
]
result = true
```

Example 2:
```
dinosaurs = [0, 7]

adjacency list = [
    [1, 2],
    [0, 3],
    [0, 3, 4],
    [1, 2],
    [2],
    [6],
    [5, 7],
    [6, 8],
    [7]
]
result = false
```


Task:
*****

Implement the function `areTheyConnected()`.
1. Write the algorithm.
2. Implement it.
3. Run the tests using `npm test` to make sure it works as expected.
4. Analyze the time complexity in terms of vertexes, V, and edges, E.


Constraints:
************

1. The graph will contain at least 2 vertexes.
2. The graph may contain cycles.
