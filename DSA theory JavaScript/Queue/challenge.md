Challenge:
***********

Implement the Queue class methods. Run the tests with `npm test` to make sure your queue behaves as expected.


Notes:
******

1. Remember that the JavaScript array already has `push` and `shift` methods that do exactly what you want.
2. Make sure to deal with the cases when the queue is empty and you're trying to dequeue from or peek at the front. When the queue is empty, throw the Error("Queue is empty.").
