Challenge:
***********

Implement the Stack class methods. Run the tests with `npm test` to make sure your stack behaves as expected.


Notes:
******

1. Remember that the JavaScript array already has `push` and `pop` methods that do exactly what you want.
2. Make sure to deal with the cases when the stack is empty and you're trying to pop from or peek at the top. When the stack is empty, throw the Error("Stack is empty.").
